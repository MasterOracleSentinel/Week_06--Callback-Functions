Callback Functions

Callback Functions, you will learn how to write callback functions.
A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument and invoked to perform a specific task. 
Callbacks enable you to write more complex programs and ensure that a given task is performed only after another task has been
completed. In this module, you will explore different types of callback functions that allow you to sort, filter, map, and 
reduce while manipulating data. 
Callback functions can be a challenging concept at first, so you need to practice writing callback functions right away to see how they work.
