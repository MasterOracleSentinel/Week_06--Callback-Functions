Callbacks Versus Regular Function Expressions

READ: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-callback-functions-what-are-callbacks-in-js-and-how-to-use-them/

When you are done, compare and contrast callback functions with regular function expressions you have used thus far in class. 
Be sure to address the following: 

What do callback functions do? What do regular function expressions do?
How do they operate?
Did you notice anything else when comparing callbacks with regular function expressions?

until the end of the “callback” section. (If you have gone to the “promises” section you have gone too far!) As you read, be sure to run the code blocks that are embedded in the article, so you can see the examples of output. You can do this by selecting a code block and typing Ctrl + Enter on your keyboard. 

It is not uncommon for new programmers to be confused about how and when to use callback functions. After reviewing the article (linked above) and its embedded code, reflect on the following questions and share your responses:

How does the outer function trigger a callback function?
What are some challenges you might encounter when using multiple callback functions to accommodate multiple asynchronous actions?
If you would like more clarity on how or when to use callback functions, please post your questions on the Q&A discussion board.
