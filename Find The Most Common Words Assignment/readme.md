Find The Most Common Words Assignment

Find the most common words

Counting word occurrence
In this assignment, you'll need to start with a given string that contains a number of words. Then, define the number of times each word appears in the given text. After that point, you will see what the top three words used are.

The starter code already has some of this functionality implemented. Please go through the code in the wordcount.js file and read the comments to understand how this logic will work.

Your task is to print to console the first three most common words that appear in a given text.

Notes:

In the starter code, some comments start with the words "TO DO." This is where you could add your lines of codes to solve this assignment.

The words will need to be scrubbed of any punctuation. To do so, you may choose to use regex and "replace", or you may choose to get rid of any punctuation marks another way. It is up to you!

Watch out for casing. The JavaScript compiler does not think a lowercase and an uppercase letter are the same letter the way humans do. To avoid this, set the entire string to be in lowercase.
