Working with ES6 functions

Using forEach Loops
When working with an array, you will often find yourself iterating through its items to perform different operations on them. This is where forEach becomes a useful tool.

array.forEach allows you to loop through each item in the array, in the ascending order, without mutating the array.

The first argument of forEach(callback, [optional]) is the callback function that is called for each and every item in an array. Each element of an array is passed into a function and the function performs its actions on each element of the array. Let's see how this works:

let seasons = ['summer','fall','winter','spring']
 
function printSeason(season){
    console.log(season);
}
 
seasons.forEach((season) => printSeason(season));
// expected result:
// "summer"
// "fall"
// "winter"
// "spring"

In this example, for each element in the seasons array, the callback function printSeason is called. Thus, each season is printed on the console.

Now, it's your turn to use forEach

Your task in this activity is to implement a function called createParagraph that takes an array of strings, 
and returns a single string containing all the items in the array separated by a space.
